Assignment #3, Multithread Alarm Clock
README file

All files are in the cssc1167 a3 directory and uploaded to blackboard through William Wood.

Files Included: main.c, threadClocks.c, alarmClock.h, makefile, README.

Compile instructions: use makefile by using make command or gcc -pthread -o tevent threadClocks.c main.c -I.

Operating Instructions: Run using ./tevent , no additional command line arguments or
						write a time in seconds for the alarm to run.

Significant design decisions: Limited alarm time size to 20 digits as no one will hopefully ever want
							  to run this alarm for that long. Included start time to show its running
							  as long as expected.

Extra features/algorithms/functionality: Our program prints the start time as an extra feature.
										 No other extra functionality/algorithms used.

Known Deficiencies or bugs: 	No major bugs or deficiencies known.

Lessons Learned: Learned how pipe() works and how it can be used to work with threads.
				 This knowledge can also be applied to fork() calls if implemented differently.
				 Also tested how alarm() would work in this situation and it didn't work entirely
				 as we wanted so we ended up not using it.
